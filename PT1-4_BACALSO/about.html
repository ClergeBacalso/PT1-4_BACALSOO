  <div class="green">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (Japanese: ジョジョの奇妙な冒険, Hepburn: JoJo no Kimyō na Bōken)
  is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hirohiko Araki. It was originally serialized in
  Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1987 to 2004, and was transferred to the monthly
  seinen manga magazine Ultra Jump in 2005. The series is divided into nine story arcs, each following a 
  new protagonist bearing the "JoJo" nickname. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is Shueisha's largest ongoing manga
  series by volume count, with its chapters collected in 130 tankōbon volumes as of May 2021. A 13-episode
  original video animation series adapting the manga's third part, Stardust Crusaders, was produced by A.P.P.P.
  and released from 1993 to 2002. The studio later produced an anime film adapting the first part, Phantom Blood,
  which was released in theaters in Japan in 2007. In October 2012, an anime television series produced by David
  Production adapting Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency began broadcast on Tokyo MX. As of December 2021, the studio
  has produced five seasons adapting through the manga's sixth part, Stone Ocean. A live-action film based on the 
  fourth part, Diamond Is Unbreakable, was released in Japan in 2017.</div>
